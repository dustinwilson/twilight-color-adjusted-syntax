Twilight Color Adjusted Syntax Theme
====================================

This is a twilight syntax theme for GitHub's Atom IDE with adjusted colors.

The colors displayed in TextMate are incorrect and are lighter and less saturated typically than what is specified in the theme data. This theme attempts to compensate for that error so that the theme appears closely to what it does in TextMate itself.
